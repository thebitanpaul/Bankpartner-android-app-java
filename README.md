# BankPartner App

A Machine Learning based dynamic app that helps the bank authority to determine whether their customer will stay in their respective bank or they have to put some efforts so that they can prevent customer loss in advance.

This is a beginner friendly app. A beginner app developer can learn about usage of textView, scrollView, Toast and their corrsponding java code.

Another important feature of this app is the use of volley library.
I've used volley to connect with heroku server to deploy my machine learning model.

## Tech Used

Android Studio, Heroku, VS code, java, Sklearn, Multiple Linear Regression, Python, Google Collab,
Jupiter Notebook, GitHub

## Lessons Learned

Learned about textView, scrollView, Toast and their corrsponding java code.

Firstly I wasn't able to deploy my flask api on heroku using pycharm.

Then I've tried the same from VScode, which fixed the error. Now the heroku server is properly connected with my app and it's working perfectly fine.
